# Wordle clone
 Bad clone of wordle.

 Initially a project to determine best ways of solving wordle, but that was abandoned.

 Still works as a simple wordle clone. Open wordle.py and start writing 5 letter words (by default in Spanish). Green letters are correct letters in the correct place. Yellow letters are correct letters in the wrong place.
